# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
$env:REPORT_GAS="true"; npx hardhat test   //windowsç”¨
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js  --network localhost
```
